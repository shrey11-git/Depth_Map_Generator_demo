1. User loads a CSV dataset (via GUI or CLI).


2. Data cleaning (data_loader.py) removes nulls, duplicates, and outliers, then saves a verified CSV.


3. Interpolation (interpolation.py) turns cleaned point data into a regular grid using CloughTocher2DInterpolator, outputs .csv and .npz.


4. Visualization (visualization.py) creates 2D contour maps, 3D surface plots, and summary tables from interpolated data.


5. Report (report.py) compiles visualizations into a styled 3-page PDF.


6. GUI (gui.py) provides an interactive PyQt6 interface for loading files, running the pipeline, showing progress, and opening results.


7. Main (main.py) serves as the entry point, defaulting to GUI but also supports CLI execution.
