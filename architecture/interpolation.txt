Purpose: Turns cleaned point data into a continuous grid for visualization.

Core Functions:
- Reads cleaned CSV (lat, lon, distance).
- Dynamically sets grid resolution based on dataset size.
- Uses CloughTocher2DInterpolator to create a gridded surface.
- Clips interpolated values within observed min/max range.
- Saves results to .csv and .npz.

Architecture:
Input: cleaned_data.csv
