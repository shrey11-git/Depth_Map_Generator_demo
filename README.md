# üó∫Ô∏è Depth Map Generator
A Python-based tool for processing raw bathymetric CSV data from Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) to generate detailed depth maps and comprehensive PDF reports.
# ‚Äª About the Project
The Depth Map Generator is a fully automated software tool designed to process raw bathymetric data in CSV format, typically collected from Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs). The tool performs data cleaning, interpolation, visualization, and report generation, producing professional 2D and 3D depth maps and a summarized PDF report. Built with a user-friendly PyQt6 interface, it supports both raw and pre-cleaned datasets, ensuring flexibility for various use cases in marine and geospatial analysis.
# ‚Äª Key Features
- Data Cleaning: Validates and cleans CSV data by handling null values, duplicates, and outliers using an adaptive IQR-based method.
- Interpolation: Applies CloughTocher2D interpolation to generate a smooth grid from sparse bathymetric data.
- Visualization: Creates high-quality 2D contour maps with satellite basemaps and interactive 3D surface plots using Matplotlib and Plotly.
- Report Generation: Produces a three-page PDF report containing a 2D map, 3D map, and a data table with key statistics.
- User Interface: Offers a modern, frameless PyQt6 GUI with file selection, data preview, and progress tracking.
- Modular Design: Separates functionality into distinct modules for maintainability and scalability.

# ‚Äª Project Structure
- Note: The actual source code is not included. The following structure and descriptions are provided in /architecture as design references to illustrate how the codebase was organized.

The project is organized into modular Python scripts, each handling a specific part of the pipeline:
- main.py: Entry point for the application, orchestrating the pipeline and launching the GUI. Supports CLI execution for debugging.
- gui.py: Implements the PyQt6-based GUI for user interaction, file selection, data preview, and visualization generation.
- data_loader.py: Handles loading, validation, and cleaning of CSV data, ensuring required columns (lat, lon, distance) and removing outliers.
- interpolation.py: Performs grid interpolation using CloughTocher2DInterpolator and saves results in CSV and NPZ formats.
- visualization.py: Generates 2D contour maps, 3D surface plots, and data tables, saving outputs as PNG files.
- report.py: Creates a three-page PDF report using ReportLab, incorporating visualizations and a data table.
All outputs (visualizations and reports) are saved in the output/visualizations directory.

# ‚Äª Usage (Demo Workflow)
This section illustrates how the tool works (as shown in the demo GIF/screenshots below).
- Launch the GUI:
  - Run python main.py or main.exe to open the Depth Map Generator interface.
- Select a CSV File:
  - Click the "Load" button to choose a bathymetric CSV file.
  - Preview the first 10 rows in the GUI.
  - Choose whether the data is raw (needs cleaning) or pre-cleaned.
- Generate Visualizations:
  - Click "Next" to proceed to the visualization step.
  - Click "Generate Visualizations" to process the data, create maps, and generate the report.
  - Monitor progress via the progress bar and feedback log.
- View Outputs:
Upon completion, click "Finish" to open the output folder containing:
  - bathymetry_2d_map.png: 2D contour map
  - bathymetry_3d_map.png: 3D surface plot
  - bathymetry_data_table.png: Data table
  - bathymetry_report.pdf: Three-page PDF report
- CLI Mode (Optional):
  - Uncomment the relevant lines in main.py to run the pipeline via the command line for debugging or automation.
- Note: Source code and executables are not included in this demo repository.

# ‚Äª Internship Context
This project was developed as part of an internship under CORATIA TECHNOLOGIES Pvt. Ltd. focused on automating bathymetric data processing for marine research. The goal was to create a user-friendly tool that transforms raw ASV data into actionable visualizations and reports, reducing manual effort for researchers and surveyors. The tool addresses the need for reliable, automated processing of geospatial data while maintaining high-quality outputs suitable for professional reports.
